<h1 align="center">Git Conflict Detector</h1>

This project identifies files on a local branch (`branchB`) that have also been modified in the remote branch (`origin/branchA`) since the last common commit ancestor (merge base) using `git` and the GitHub API, without fetching the remote branch to the local machine.

The real-life purpose of this application is to help developers detect potential conflicts before merging changes, allowing them to resolve issues in advance.


## Overview

The CLI tool is implemented in Python, with the widely used `requests` library as its only external dependency for interacting with the GitHub API.

The repository includes Bash (`.sh`) and Batch (`.cmd`) scripts to make setting up the built-in demo more convenient.

Code quality is ensured through:
- `flake8` (with multiple plugins) â€” the most common linter for Python
- `mypy` â€” a static type checker enforcing strong typing
- `pytest` â€” a popular testing framework

The code is packed with various checks and extensive error handling, ensuring that internal issues, input errors, or API-related problems result in clear and user-friendly messages.


## Demo

The repository includes demo branches that replicate the scenario described in the project's specification. Once the demo is set up, the repository will be structured as follows:

- A shared merge-base commit (referred to as `branchA_outdated`)
- A remote-only branch `branchA`, which is one commit ahead of the merge-base commit
- A local-only branch `branchB`, which is also one commit ahead of the merge-base commit

<a id="origin"></a>
> [!NOTE]
> The project does not rely on a local copy of `branchA`, meaning it may be out of sync with `origin/branchA` or even absent entirely. In this demo, `branchA` exists only remotely to emphasize this. That's why I prefix it with `origin/` â€” ensuring that `git merge-base branchB origin/branchA` works correctly. Without this, `git merge-base branchB branchA` would fail if `branchA` is missing locally.

For your convenience, here is a visual representation:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 (tested with 3.13) and Git should be installed on your local machine
- GitHub API access token [generated here](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) with `Read` access to `code` and `metadata` for the desired repository

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. <a id="dependencies"></a>Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the Git structure by running the provided `setup` script (`setup.cmd` or `./setup.sh`)

    <br>
    <div align="center"><b>After setup</b></div>
    <img with="100%" src="assets/after_setup.png">

    </details>

3. Run the script with the demo arguments: `branchB [origin/]branchA repo_owner repo_name [--access_token] [--repo_path]`

    `get_diff.cmd` and `./get_diff.sh` are provided for your convenience. For example:

    ```bash
    ./get_diff.sh branchB origin/branchA npanuhin edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector
    # or
    python3 get_diff.py branchB branchA npanuhin edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector
    # or (if this repository was private and located in a different directory)
    python3 get_diff.py branchB branchA npanuhin edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector {github_token} --repo_path ../some_path/
    ```

    Parameters:
    - `branchB` â€” local branch, which will be checked for conflicts
    - `[origin/]branchA` â€” remote branch, which we compare against. `origin/` will be added automatically, if omitted[^1]
    - `repo_owner`, `repo_name` â€” GitHub repository owner and name
    - `--access_token` â€” GitHub API token. Not required for public repositories
    - `--repo_path {local path}` â€” path to the local repository. By default, the current directory is used

    ```

4. If you want to reset the Git structure to the initial state, you can either run `rollback.cmd` or `./rollback.sh`, or clone the repository again

<summary>Personal remarks about the setup process</summary>

> Since different tools and workflows exist for managing Python environments and repositories (e.g., using virtualenv), I haven't included a universal installation script. I hope this doesn't cause any inconvenience ðŸ˜‡
>
> However, here's a quick example for Windows:
> ```bash
> git clone git@github.com:npanuhin/edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector.git
> cd edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector
> pip install -r -U requirements.txt
> setup
> get_diff branchB branchA npanuhin edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector
> ```

</details>


## Testing

All code quality checks (`flake8`, `mypy`, and `pytest`) are automatically run via GitHub Actions on each push: <a href="https://github.com/npanuhin/edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector/actions"><img src="https://github.com/npanuhin/edu-JetBrains-Git-Conflict-Detector/actions/workflows/python-lint-test.yml/badge.svg"></a>

To run tests manually, [install dependencies](#dependencies) and execute:

```bash
pytest
# or
python3 -m pytest
```

[^1]: The reson for adding `origin` is [mentioned here](#origin). Is is possible to fetch the list of remotes using `git remote`, so if for example `branchA` is not on `origin`, we might detect that. This is one of the potential improvements for the project
